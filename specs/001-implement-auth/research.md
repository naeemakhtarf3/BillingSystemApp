# Research: User Authentication System

**Feature**: 001-implement-auth  
**Date**: 2025-01-27  
**Status**: Complete

## Overview

This document consolidates research findings and architectural decisions for implementing the authentication system in the React Native mobile application.

## Research Tasks

### 1. React Context API for Authentication State Management

**Task**: Determine best practices for managing global authentication state using React Context API in React Native applications.

**Decision**: Use React Context API with `useContext` hook for global state access.

**Rationale**: 
- Context API provides a simple, built-in solution for sharing authentication state across all components without prop drilling
- Suitable for medium-sized applications where state management libraries like Redux add unnecessary complexity
- Integrates seamlessly with React Native and TypeScript
- Performance is acceptable for auth state which updates infrequently (login/logout events)

**Alternatives Considered**:
- **Redux/Redux Toolkit**: Rejected due to added complexity for a simple auth state that doesn't require complex middleware or time-travel debugging
- **Zustand**: Rejected to maintain consistency with existing codebase and avoid introducing additional dependencies
- **React Query**: Considered for API state management but Context API is sufficient for auth-specific state (user, tokens, loading flags)

**Implementation Pattern**:
- Create `AuthContext` using `React.createContext`
- Provide `AuthProvider` component that wraps the app and manages state
- Expose `useAuth` custom hook for convenient access
- Store state with `useState` hook within provider

### 2. AsyncStorage for Token Persistence

**Task**: Research secure token storage practices using AsyncStorage in React Native.

**Decision**: Use `@react-native-community/async-storage` for storing authentication tokens and user data.

**Rationale**:
- AsyncStorage provides persistent key-value storage that survives app restarts
- Part of React Native ecosystem with good community support
- Simple API for storing JSON-serializable data (tokens, user objects)
- Cross-platform (iOS and Android) compatibility
- Secure storage on device (not accessible by other apps)

**Alternatives Considered**:
- **React Native Keychain**: Considered for enhanced security but adds complexity for basic token storage. May be considered for future security enhancements.
- **SQLite**: Rejected as overkill for simple key-value token storage
- **MMKV**: Considered for better performance but AsyncStorage is sufficient and standard

**Storage Strategy**:
- Store tokens as JSON: `{ access_token, refresh_token, token_type }`
- Store user object separately for quick access
- Use consistent key naming: `@auth:tokens`, `@auth:user`
- Implement clear error handling for storage failures

**Security Considerations**:
- Tokens are stored unencrypted in AsyncStorage (device-level security provided by OS)
- For production, consider encrypting sensitive data before storage (future enhancement)
- Clear all auth data on logout
- Handle corrupted data gracefully

### 3. React Navigation Protected Routes

**Task**: Research navigation protection patterns for authenticated routes in React Navigation.

**Decision**: Implement navigation guard using React Navigation's conditional rendering based on authentication state.

**Rationale**:
- React Navigation v6+ provides declarative navigation based on state
- Simple conditional rendering in `App.tsx` determines which navigator to show
- No need for complex navigation middleware or interceptors
- Type-safe with TypeScript navigation types

**Implementation Pattern**:
- Check `isAuthenticated` from AuthContext in `App.tsx`
- Conditionally render Stack.Navigator with either:
  - Auth stack (LoginScreen) if not authenticated
  - Main stack (Dashboard, protected screens) if authenticated
- Navigate programmatically after successful login

**Alternatives Considered**:
- **Navigation guards/middleware**: Rejected as unnecessary complexity for simple auth check
- **Higher-order component (HOC)**: Rejected in favor of simpler conditional rendering at app root
- **Route-level guards**: Considered but app-level conditional rendering is cleaner

**Protection Strategy**:
- Protected screens (Dashboard, etc.) are only accessible when `isAuthenticated === true`
- Automatic redirect to Login screen if authentication state becomes false
- Handle token expiration by clearing auth state and redirecting

- React Navigation v7 documentation

### 4. API Error Handling Patterns

**Task**: Determine error handling patterns for authentication API calls in React Native.

**Decision**: Implement try-catch blocks with generic error messages as per specification requirements.

**Rationale**:
- Specification requires generic "Login failed" messages (FR-010)
- Try-catch provides standard error handling
- Network errors automatically caught and handled
- Consistent user experience regardless of error type

**Error Handling Strategy**:
- Wrap all API calls in try-catch blocks
- Catch network errors (fetch failures, timeouts)
- Catch API errors (4xx, 5xx status codes)
- Catch JSON parsing errors
- Display generic "Login failed" message for all error types
- Log detailed errors for debugging (development only)

**Alternatives Considered**:
- **Error boundary**: Rejected as overkill for API errors which are expected and handled gracefully
- **Centralized error handler**: Considered but simple try-catch is sufficient for current scope
- **Error differentiation**: Rejected per spec requirement for generic messages

**Implementation Pattern**:
```typescript
try {
  const response = await fetch(loginEndpoint, options);
  if (!response.ok) throw new Error('Login failed');
  const data = await response.json();
  return data;
} catch (error) {
  throw new Error('Login failed');
}
```

### 5. Token Validation on App Restart

**Task**: Research token validation strategies when app restarts with stored tokens.

**Decision**: Optimistic token validation - assume tokens are valid and validate via API call failure.

**Rationale**:
- Specification clarification (Q2): Assume tokens valid, check via API failure
- Simplifies app initialization flow
- Reduces unnecessary validation API calls
- Token validity determined naturally when fetching user profile

**Validation Strategy**:
- On app start: Load tokens from AsyncStorage
- Immediately attempt to fetch user profile using tokens
- If API call succeeds: Tokens valid, proceed to dashboard
- If API call fails (401/403): Tokens invalid/expired, clear storage, show login
- No separate token validation endpoint needed

**Alternatives Considered**:
- **Separate token validation endpoint**: Rejected as unnecessary complexity and extra API call
- **Local expiration checking**: Rejected as tokens don't include expiration in this implementation
- **Token refresh on app start**: Rejected per spec clarification (no automatic refresh)

- JWT token validation patterns
- React Native app lifecycle and initialization

## Technology Choices Summary

| Technology | Version | Purpose | Rationale |
|------------|---------|---------|-----------|
| React Context API | Built-in | Global auth state | Simple, no additional dependencies |
| AsyncStorage | @react-native-community/async-storage | Token/user persistence | Standard React Native solution |
| React Navigation | 7.x | Protected routes | Declarative navigation with auth guards |
| TypeScript | 5.8.3 | Type safety | Constitution requirement, strict mode |
| Fetch API | Built-in | HTTP requests | Standard, no additional dependencies |
| twrnc | 4.10.1 | Styling | Constitution requirement, Tailwind utility classes |

## Key Architectural Decisions

1. **No automatic token refresh**: Per specification, expired tokens trigger immediate logout and redirect to login screen
2. **Generic error messages**: All authentication errors display "Login failed" per specification
3. **Optimistic token validation**: Tokens assumed valid until API call fails
4. **Context-based state management**: Simple Context API sufficient for auth state scope
5. **No client-side validation**: Form submission always attempts API call, validation handled by backend

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Token storage corruption | Medium | Implement error handling for AsyncStorage read failures, gracefully fallback to login |
| Network timeout during login | Low | Generic error message and retry capability (user-initiated) |
| Token expiration during active use | Medium | Clear auth state and redirect to login (per spec) |
| App crash during session restoration | Low | Try-catch around initialization, fallback to login screen |

## Future Enhancements (Out of Scope)

- Token encryption before storage
- Automatic token refresh mechanism
- Biometric authentication
- Two-factor authentication (2FA)
- Session timeout warnings
- Remember me / persistent sessions
