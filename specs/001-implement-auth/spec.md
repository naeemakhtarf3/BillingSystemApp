# Feature Specification: User Authentication System

**Feature Branch**: `001-implement-auth`  
**Created**: 2025-01-27  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Create an AuthContext using React Context API to manage global auth state. State should include: user (id, email, name, role, created_at), tokens (access_token, refresh_token, token_type), isAuthenticated boolean, login function, logout function, and loading boolean. Persist auth state using AsyncStorage. Create authApi.js with login and fetchUser functions. Update LoginScreen with form and authentication flow. Add user profile display to DashboardScreen. Create reusable UserProfileIcon component. Implement navigation protection. Add auth flow in App.js to check AsyncStorage on mount."

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-01-27

- Q: When the access token expires during an active session, how should the system handle refresh? → A: No automatic refresh — redirect to login when token expires
- Q: When the app restarts and finds stored tokens, how should it determine if they're still valid? → A: Assume tokens are valid — only check when API calls fail
- Q: When login fails, should error messages differentiate failure types (e.g., invalid credentials vs network error vs server error)? → A: Show generic "Login failed" message for all failures
- Q: When the app starts and attempts to restore a session from stored tokens, should a loading indicator be displayed? → A: Show loading indicator while checking tokens and fetching user info
- Q: Should the login form validate input fields (e.g., require username and password) before allowing submission, or only validate on the backend? → A: No client-side validation — submit immediately, let backend validate

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - User Logs In Successfully (Priority: P1)

A clinic staff member opens the mobile app and needs to log in to access their dashboard. They enter their credentials (username and password) on the login screen and tap the "Log In" button. The system authenticates them, retrieves their profile information, and automatically navigates them to the dashboard screen where they can access clinic billing features.

**Why this priority**: Authentication is the foundational requirement - users cannot access any features without it. This is the primary entry point for all system functionality.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by launching the app, entering valid credentials on the login screen, and verifying successful navigation to the dashboard with user information displayed. Delivers the ability for authorized users to access the system.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the user opens the app for the first time, **When** they enter valid credentials (username: admin@clinic.com, password: admin123) and tap "Log In", **Then** the system displays a loading indicator, authenticates the user, stores their session, and navigates to the dashboard screen

2. **Given** the user is on the login screen, **When** they enter invalid credentials and tap "Log In", **Then** the system displays a generic "Login failed" error message and keeps them on the login screen

3. **Given** the user enters credentials, **When** the network request fails due to connectivity issues or any other error, **Then** the system displays a generic "Login failed" error message and does not navigate away from the login screen

### User Story 2 - User Views Profile and Logs Out (Priority: P2)

An authenticated clinic staff member is on the dashboard and wants to view their profile information or log out. They tap the profile icon in the top-right corner of the dashboard. The system displays their name, role, and a logout option. When they tap logout, the system clears their session and returns them to the login screen.

**Why this priority**: While secondary to login, profile viewing and logout are essential for user control and security. Users need to see their identity and be able to end their session securely.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by logging in, accessing the dashboard, tapping the profile icon to view profile details, then logging out and verifying return to login screen. Delivers user identity confirmation and secure session termination.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the user is authenticated and on the dashboard, **When** they tap the profile icon in the top-right corner, **Then** a profile popover or modal appears displaying their name (e.g., "Dr. Sarah Johnson"), role (e.g., "admin"), and a logout button

2. **Given** the profile modal is displayed, **When** the user taps the logout button, **Then** the system clears all authentication data, removes it from local storage, and navigates the user to the login screen

3. **Given** the profile modal is displayed, **When** the user taps outside the modal or dismisses it, **Then** the modal closes and returns to the dashboard view

### User Story 3 - App Restores Session on Restart (Priority: P3)

A clinic staff member closes the app during their work shift and later reopens it. Instead of requiring them to log in again, the system automatically detects their previously stored authentication tokens, validates them, retrieves their user information, and takes them directly to the dashboard screen without showing the login screen.

**Why this priority**: While not as critical as initial login, session persistence significantly improves user experience by eliminating redundant login steps during normal usage patterns within a work session.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by logging in successfully, completely closing the app, reopening it, and verifying automatic navigation to dashboard without login screen appearing. Delivers seamless user experience across app restarts.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the user previously logged in successfully and closed the app, **When** they reopen the app, **Then** the system displays a loading indicator, checks local storage for tokens, assumes they are valid, retrieves user information using those tokens, and navigates directly to the dashboard if the API call succeeds

2. **Given** stored tokens exist and the app starts, **When** the user information retrieval API call fails due to invalid/expired tokens, **Then** the system clears the tokens from storage and displays the login screen instead of the dashboard

3. **Given** no authentication data exists in local storage, **When** the app starts, **Then** the system displays the login screen immediately

4. **Given** the user is authenticated and actively using the app, **When** the access token expires (detected via API error response), **Then** the system clears authentication state, removes tokens from storage, and redirects to the login screen

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the API server is unreachable during login?
- How does the system handle malformed API responses?
- What happens when stored tokens are corrupted in local storage?
- How does the system handle logout when network connectivity is unavailable?
- What happens if the user profile fetch succeeds but returns incomplete data (e.g., missing role)?
- How does the system handle rapid multiple login attempts?
- What happens when the user rotates the device or the app goes to background during authentication?
- What happens when an API call fails due to expired access token while the user is actively using the app?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST maintain a global authentication state accessible throughout the application

- **FR-002**: Authentication state MUST include: user object (containing id, email, name, role, created_at), tokens object (containing access_token, refresh_token, token_type), isAuthenticated boolean flag, loading boolean flag, login function, and logout function

- **FR-003**: System MUST persist authentication state (tokens and user data) to local device storage so authentication survives app restarts

- **FR-004**: System MUST provide a login service that communicates with the backend authentication endpoint, accepting username and password credentials and returning authentication tokens (access_token, refresh_token, token_type)

- **FR-005**: System MUST provide a user profile service that retrieves authenticated user information from the backend using the access token and returns the user object

- **FR-006**: Authentication services MUST handle network errors and provide meaningful error messages that can be displayed to users

- **FR-007**: Login screen MUST display a form with username and password input fields with default test values (username: admin@clinic.com, password: admin123) for testing purposes

- **FR-008**: Login screen MUST display a loading indicator on the login button during authentication attempts

- **FR-023**: Login form MUST allow submission regardless of input field values (no client-side validation required) — all validation is performed by the backend API

- **FR-009**: On successful login, the system MUST: store tokens in authentication state, retrieve user profile information using the access token, save user data to persistent storage, and navigate to Dashboard screen

- **FR-010**: On failed login, the system MUST display a generic "Login failed" error message regardless of failure type (invalid credentials, network error, server error) and reset loading state

- **FR-011**: Dashboard screen MUST display a welcome message at the top showing the authenticated user's name and role (e.g., "Welcome, Dr. Sarah Johnson (admin)")

- **FR-012**: Dashboard screen MUST display a profile icon (person icon) in the top-right corner that is tappable

- **FR-013**: When profile icon is tapped, the system MUST display a popover or modal showing: user's name, user's role, and a logout button

- **FR-014**: System MUST provide a reusable profile icon component that renders a person icon and displays the profile popover/modal when tapped

- **FR-015**: Profile icon component logout action MUST: clear all authentication state, remove all authentication data from persistent storage, and navigate to Login screen

- **FR-016**: Navigation MUST protect Dashboard and other authenticated screens - if user is not authenticated, redirect to Login screen

- **FR-017**: App initialization MUST check local persistent storage for existing authentication tokens when the app starts

- **FR-018**: If tokens exist in persistent storage on app start, the system MUST display a loading indicator while retrieving user information using those tokens, then navigate to Dashboard if successful

- **FR-019**: If no tokens exist in persistent storage on app start, the system MUST display Login screen (no loading indicator needed)

- **FR-020**: When an access token expires during an active session (indicated by API response or validation failure), the system MUST clear all authentication state, remove tokens from persistent storage, and redirect the user to the Login screen (no automatic token refresh)

- **FR-021**: If the user information retrieval on app start fails due to invalid/expired tokens, the system MUST treat this as an authentication failure, clear tokens from storage, and display the Login screen

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **User**: Represents an authenticated clinic staff member. Key attributes: unique identifier (id), email address, display name, assigned role (Admin, Doctor, Billing Staff, Receptionist), account creation timestamp. Used to determine access permissions and personalize the interface.

- **Authentication Tokens**: Represents session credentials for API access. Key attributes: access token (short-lived credential for API requests), refresh token (long-lived credential for obtaining new access tokens), token type (typically "Bearer"). Stored securely to maintain authenticated state.

- **Authentication State**: Represents the current authentication status of the application. Includes user information, token set, authentication status flag, loading indicators, and methods for login/logout operations. Managed globally across the application.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Users can complete the login process from entering credentials to viewing the dashboard in under 5 seconds when network conditions are normal

- **SC-002**: 95% of users successfully authenticate on their first attempt when using valid credentials

- **SC-003**: App successfully restores authenticated sessions on app restart for 99% of cases when valid tokens exist in persistent storage

- **SC-004**: Users can view their profile information and log out within 2 seconds of tapping the profile icon

- **SC-005**: System displays clear, actionable error messages within 1 second of authentication failures

- **SC-006**: Authentication state persists correctly across app restarts for 100% of successful login sessions

- **SC-007**: Navigation protection prevents unauthenticated users from accessing protected screens 100% of the time

## Assumptions

- Backend authentication API is available at the development endpoint (assumed localhost for initial development)
- Authentication follows standard token-based authentication patterns with access and refresh tokens
- User roles supported: Admin, Doctor, Billing Staff, Receptionist
- Local device storage is available and persists data across app restarts
- Network connectivity is assumed for initial authentication; offline token validation strategy will be handled in future features
- Default test credentials (admin@clinic.com / admin123) are for development/testing only and will be removed or secured in production

## Dependencies

- Backend authentication API must be operational and accessible
- User database must contain valid user records with email/username, password, name, and role fields
- Network connectivity required for initial authentication and user profile retrieval
- Local persistent storage must be available on the device
